#ShakeMusicBar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zhang699/ShakeMusicBar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zhang699/ShakeMusicBar)


A ShakeMusicBarView is music indicator, which imitates from Google Play Music android application, used to indicate the music is playing or stopped. 



#Demo

#Usage

Use it in your layout.xml.
```xml
<ntut.shakemusicbar.library.ShakeMusicBarView
    android:id="@+id/shake_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="200dp"
    android:layout_below="@id/btn_switch"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    custom:barColor="@android:color/darker_gray"
    custom:barCount="3"
    custom:barVelocity="150"
    custom:barInvsInPx="3" />
```

Get instance and call `init` method to start to shake
```java
mBarView = (ShakeMusicBarView) findViewById(R.id.shake_view);
	
mBarView.setOnInitFinishedListener(new OnInitFinishedListener() {

      @Override
      public void onInitFinished() {
          //do something after the initialization is done. if there is nothings to do, 
          //you can give up putting this listener
      }
});
		
mBarView.init();
```
While you want to stop shaking and then stop to specified hight
, you can use `shake` and `stopToHeight` methods.

```java
mBarView.shake(false);
mBarView.stopToHeight(5.0f); //stop to 5 pixel height from the base.
```

Change `barVelocity`, `barColor` `barCount` property dynamically.
```java
mBarView.setVelocity(5); // In pixels
mBarView.changeColor(0xffff0000); // set background color of bar to red
mBarView.changeBarCount(3); // change number of bars reside in the barview to 3
```

You also can specifiy drawable as bar's background.
```java
mBarView.changeDrawable(R.drawable.rectangle_background);
```
